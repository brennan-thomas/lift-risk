### Project Topic Area
Object lifting detection and risk classification using machine learning on IMU sensor data

### Abstract
Repeated lifting of heavy objects creates increased risk for incidences of lower back pain. Determining when a person is lifting in a risky way can help a worker learn to avoid dangerous lifts. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning approach for detecting the risk level of an individual lift based on IMU data from various sensors placed on a workerâ€™s body.
